            <p> <b>Introduction: </b> I have created a website for a fashion and lifestyle brand called ‘Waves’. It’s a blog type website where you can know about their operations, facilities and stories. It’s a simple website where I created different pages (accessible from the top navigation menu) for different purposes. This website tells the story about trending fashion, styles, appearances and lifestyle goals. 
                I choose to implement a blog type structure. I think it’s the best way to represent the story I want to tell through my website.</p>

            <p> <b>Usability: </b>I considered the following 3 principles of good website usability:
                <ol>
                    <li><p>
                        I tried to ensure my visitors don’t get an error trying to load the site and my site can handle different screen sizes.                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        I ensured good ‘clarity’ of my website so that visitors can reach their goals and find their desired content as quickly as possible.                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        I also tried to ensure that my website contents are “relevant” to the user demand.                    </p></li>

        <div class="learning">
            <p> <b>Learning: </b>I learned some techniques while creating this website. I am mentioning three of them here:
